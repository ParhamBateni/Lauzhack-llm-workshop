# Chatbot Assistant Template

A comprehensive project template for building AI-powered chatbot assistants with multiple LLM integrations and a modern web interface.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project serves as a practical playground and implementation template for integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into web applications. It consists of three main components:

1. **LLM Playground** (`practices.ipynb`) - A Jupyter notebook for experimenting with different LLM APIs
2. **Backend Server** - FastAPI-based chatbot server with LLM integration
3. **Frontend Template** - AI-generated modern web interface for testing the chatbot

## 🧪 LLM Playground (`practices.ipynb`)

The Jupyter notebook serves as a comprehensive learning environment for working with different LLM APIs and frameworks:

### Features:
- **Hugging Face Integration**: Direct model usage with transformers library
- **OpenAI API**: Text generation, image understanding, and conversational AI
- **Langchain Framework**: Chain-based LLM applications and sequential processing
- **Practical Examples**: Text generation, sentiment analysis, translation, and more

### Supported APIs:
- 🤗 Hugging Face Transformers
- 🧠 OpenAI GPT models
- 🔗 Langchain framework
- 🎯 Custom pipeline implementations

## 🤖 Backend Server

A FastAPI-based server designed to handle chatbot interactions:

### Current Features:
- CORS-enabled API endpoints
- Chat message processing endpoint (`/chat`)
- Environment variable management
- Error handling and logging

### Planned Implementation:
- LLM integration (OpenAI, Hugging Face, or custom models)
- Conversation memory and context management
- Response streaming capabilities
- Authentication and rate limiting

## 🎨 Frontend Template

**Note**: The entire frontend codebase was generated by AI for the purpose of testing the chatbot integration.

### Features:
- Modern, responsive design
- Interactive chat widget
- Real-time messaging interface
- Professional business website template
- Mobile-friendly layout

### Pages:
- **Home**: Hero section with company overview
- **Services**: Service offerings and features
- **Products**: Product catalog
- **About**: Company information
- **Contact**: Contact form and information

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd chatbot_assistant_template
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token_here
   ```

4. **Run the setup script** (optional):
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python server.py
   ```
   The server will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

2. **Open the frontend**:
   Navigate to `frontend/static_pages/index.html` in your browser and try chatting with the chat assistant bot

3. **Experiment with LLMs**:
   Open `practices.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to explore different LLM APIs

## 🔧 Development

### Backend Development
The server is built with FastAPI and includes:
- RESTful API endpoints
- CORS middleware for frontend integration
- Environment variable management
- Structured error handling

### Frontend Development
The frontend includes:
- Vanilla JavaScript for chat functionality
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive design
- Font Awesome icons
- Modern UI/UX patterns

### LLM Integration
The notebook provides examples for:
- Direct API calls to various LLM providers
- Framework-based implementations (Langchain)
- Custom pipeline development
- Model comparison and testing

## 📚 Learning Resources

This project is designed as a learning tool for:
- LLM API integration
- Web development with AI
- Chatbot architecture
- Modern frontend development
- Backend API design
